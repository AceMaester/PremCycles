PremCycles
==========

Aim is to come up with a list of potential Hamilton cycles for different English Premier League seasons. 
Vertices represent teams and edges represent wins.
For example if there is hypothetically 3 teams in the league, a Hamilton cycle is team 1 beating team 2, 2 beating 3 and 3 beating 1.

This is an NP graph problem so I will have to research different algorithms (brute force etc). A Hamilton cycle is almost ceratain to exist at the end of a season so a challenge will be finding at what time in the season a Hamilton cycle first appears.
